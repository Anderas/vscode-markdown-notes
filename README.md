## Known Issues

- `ctrl+o` vscode vim jumplist does not work after a goto definition: https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/3277

## TODO:

- Provide better support for ignore patterns, eg, don't complete `file.md` if it is within `ignored_dir/`
- Should we support filename without extension, eg, assume `[[file]]` is a reference to `file.md`?
- Add syntax highlighting and search for `#tags`. See [also](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60293955/is-cmdshiftf-in-vscode-supposed-to-respect-the-editor-wordseparators-setting)
