# VS Code Markdown Notes

Enable [[wiki-links]] for fast-navigation between notes.

There are many great note-taking applications ([Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/), [nvalt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/), [Bear](https://bear.app/), [FSNotes](https://fsnot.es/)), but few of them offer the extensibility of VS Code and the ability to use Vim bindings for editing notes.

This extension provides a number of the best features invented by these other great apps.

### `[[wiki-links]]`

A popular feature in [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Bear](https://bear.app/) is the ability to quickly reference other notes using "Cross-Note Links" in the `[[wiki-link]]` style.

VS Code Markdown notes provides syntax highlighting, auto-complete, Go to Definition (`editor.action.revealDefinition`), and Peek Definition (`editor.action.peekDefinition`) support for wiki-links to notes in a workspace.



### dev

Run `npm install` first.

## Known Issues

- The `ctrl+o` VSCodeVim jumplist shortcut does not return you to the correct place after using "Go to Definition" (`ctrl+]`): https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/3277 (The VSCode `Go Back` command (`ctrl+-`) does work, however.)

## TODO:

- Provide better support for ignore patterns, eg, don't complete `file.md` if it is within `ignored_dir/`
- Should we support filename without extension, eg, assume `[[file]]` is a reference to `file.md`?
- Add syntax highlighting and search for `#tags`. See [also](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60293955/is-cmdshiftf-in-vscode-supposed-to-respect-the-editor-wordseparators-setting)
