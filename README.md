# VS Code Markdown Notes

Use `[[wiki-links]]` and `#tags` for fast-navigation between notes kept in in a VS Code workspace. Quickly create new notes from a Tilte Case Note Name.

There are many great note-taking applications ([Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/), [nvalt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/), [Bear](https://bear.app/), [FSNotes](https://fsnot.es/)), but few of them offer the extensibility of VS Code and the ability to use Vim bindings for editing notes.

This extension provides a number of the best features invented by these other great apps.

You can [install it from the VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes). See also my other customizations for note-taking in this blog post: [Suping Up VS Code as a Markdown Notebook](https://kortina.nyc/essays/suping-up-vs-code-as-a-markdown-notebook/).

### `[[wiki-links]]`

A popular feature in [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Bear](https://bear.app/) is the ability to quickly reference other notes using "Cross-Note Links" in the `[[wiki-link]]` style.

VS Code Markdown notes provides syntax highlighting, auto-complete, Go to Definition (`editor.action.revealDefinition`), and Peek Definition (`editor.action.peekDefinition`) support for wiki-links to notes in a workspace.

By default, the extension assumes each markdown file in a workspace has a unique name, so that `note.md` will resolve to the file with this name, regardless of whether or not this file exists in any subdirectory path. This tends to be a bit cleaner, but if you want support for multiple files with the same name, in `settings.json` set `"vscodeMarkdownNotes.workspaceFilenameConvention": "relativePaths"`, and you'll get completions like `note1/note.md` and `../note2/note.md`.

### #tags

Syntax highlighting for `#tags`.

### New Note command

Provides a command for quickly creating a new note.

You can bind this to a keyboard shortcut by adding to your `keybindings.json`:

```json
    {
        "key": "alt+n",
        "command": "vscodeMarkdownNotes.newNote",
    },
```

### FAQ

- "Autocomplete / Intellisense is not working - why?"
    - Make sure that quick suggestions are enabled in Markdown. Put this in settings.json:
    
    ```
    "[markdown]": {
       "editor.quickSuggestions": true
    } 
    ```
- "New note is not working - why?"
    - New Note works only when you are in a workspace. Look [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44629890/what-is-a-workspace-in-visual-studio-code) for more information on workspaces in VS Code.

### Known Issues

- Filename completion seems to be triggering when not in the `[[` context.
- The `ctrl+o` VSCodeVim jumplist shortcut does not return you to the correct place after using "Go to Definition" (`ctrl+]`): https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/3277 (The VSCode `Go Back` command (`ctrl+-`) does work, however.)
- This extension sets the `wordPattern` for 'markdown' in order to (1) enable proper completion of relative paths and (2) make it such that if you `cmd+shift+f` on a `#tag` the search will prefill with "#tag" and not just "tag":
  <br />`vscode.languages.setLanguageConfiguration('markdown', { wordPattern: /([\#\.\/\\\w_]+)/ });`

### TODO

- Add command to create file based on name in the wiki-link under the cursor
- Add command to create new note with name + heading
- Provide better support for ignore patterns, eg, don't complete `file.md` if it is within `ignored_dir/`
- Should we support filename without extension, eg, assume `[[file]]` is a reference to `file.md`?
- Should we support links to headings? eg, `file.md#heading-text`?
- Add syntax highlighting and search for `#tags`. See [also](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60293955/is-cmdshiftf-in-vscode-supposed-to-respect-the-editor-wordseparators-setting)
